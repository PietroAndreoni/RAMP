general rules:
- just adding code, no modifing core (maybe inefficient but faster and more readable)
- comment every line modded with #PIETRO: 
- create parallel function when possible

INTERVENTIONS FIRST COMMIT:

-- creation of Profile_users list --
in stochastic_process.py, added a new bidimensional list Profile_users[number of periods][number of users] (TO BE transposed! - or create it right)
this lead to small changes in inizialize.py (where the empty list in inizialized) and RAMP_run.py, which now receives as output from stochastic_process.py also Profile_users

MISSING a mod to post_process, in particolar the Profile_series object (which simply create an array from the list)
